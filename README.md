# ðŸ“¦ Retail Demand Forecasting using Time Series Analysis

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting product demand using historical transaction data from a UK-based online retail company. Leveraging time-series modeling, the goal is to predict **monthly demand** one month in advance â€” enabling better inventory planning, demand-driven stock replenishment, and operational efficiency.

## ðŸ”§ Project Workflow

### 1. ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified top-selling products, sales peaks, and customer trends
- Analyzed seasonal demand shifts and geographical distributions
- Visualized sales dynamics through time-series plots and bar charts

### 2. ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Removed duplicates and handled missing or inconsistent values
- Converted invoice timestamps into a usable datetime index
- Created monthly aggregation features and customer segments for analysis

### 3. ðŸ”® Forecasting Model Development
- Built and compared multiple time-series models including:
  - ARIMA
  - Facebook Prophet
  - Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
- Selected the most accurate model based on validation performance

### 4. ðŸ§ª Model Validation
- Evaluated predictions using RMSE and MAE
- Tested the model's ability to accurately forecast one month ahead

## ðŸ“¦ Outcome & Utility

The final forecasting model helps anticipate monthly product demand, reducing risks of understocking or overstocking. This approach supports:
- Smarter inventory management
- Improved customer satisfaction
- Strategic planning for high-demand periods
